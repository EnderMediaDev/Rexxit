# Rexxit: Jurassic Pack
## Official Issue Tracker

An issue tracker for the [Rexxit: Jurassic Pack](http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/rexxit-jurassic-pack) modpack created by Amaxter, published under EnderMedia, and distributed via the Technic Platform.

### What do do with Logs/Crash Reports
If you have a crash report or logs (found in Modpack options in launcher > Open Pack Directory and then crash reports folder or logs folder) then please submit them via a service like pastebin.com so that they don't take up so much space. Any crashes/logs submitted in plain text will be ignored.

> Crash reports without Pastebin suck, and they should like totally burn in a fire

-A very smart man

###Issue Guidelines
If there is a bug/issue you are noticing please be as specific as possible in describing it, the more specific, the more helpful you will be! Mod/General suggestions while allowed are by no means guaranteed to work, and "Out of Memory" and outdated java crashes will be ignored and closed as those aren't related to the pack.

###Proper Conduct
- You will not be stupid
- You will not submit an issue while angry/drunk/under the influence (or *all three*)
- You will not insult the pack or post irrelevant content
- You will not threaten the pack developers/other people
- You will not submit a crash report that says "Out of Memory" (If you do, well, let's **not** talk about that)
- Lastly, you will use common sense, which should basically include all the stuff said above plus a bunch of other stuff that's a given.
